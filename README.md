# ADSDB_project1

run the python files in ./scripts to process each step from one zone to the following. the notebooks in ./notebooks have been used to develop the code

(maybe it could be useful to have a main.py file that runs all the zones?)

Objects.json contains the properties of all the objects to be processed. So, to add a new object to the pipeline, it is only needed to add it to Objects.json

The logs of which files are processed can be stored in ./logs
